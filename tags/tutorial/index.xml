However, as I am on Manjaro Linux - a Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, I was unable to get the native support that MacOS has.
I stumbled upon UxPlay as a potential solution for this problem.
UxPlay is an AirPlay Unix mirroring server that acts like an AppleTV for screen-mirroring on the machine that is running the server.</description></item><item><title>Deploying discord bots written in Kotlin to Heroku</title><link>/post/deploying-discord-bot-kotlin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/deploying-discord-bot-kotlin/</guid><description>Over my time in TPH, I have noticed that a common woe aspiring bot developers have is that they are unable to host their Discord bot online as they may not have access to a credit card.
Introducing Heroku! While the official Discord bots used in TPH - like HotBot - is hosted via paid platforms, there are free alternatives to deploying your bot online. This is where Heroku comes into the picture!</description></item><item><title>Gatsby.js + GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages = Match Made in Heaven?</title><link>/post/gatsby-gh-pages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/gatsby-gh-pages/</guid><description>After a long hiatus induced by the demons that was school, I have finally defeated the final boss and graduated!
With that, I have started to work on re-building my portfolio site (you&amp;rsquo;re seeing it right now!). I wanted to learn Gatsby.js and so I figured it would be the best time to do so! While working with Gatsby.js, one of the issues that I had faced was not having a proper guide on deploying Gatsby.</description></item><item><title>Heroku x Docker x Discord bot x Kotlin</title><link>/post/heroku-kotlin-discord-bot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/heroku-kotlin-discord-bot/</guid><description>You may be wondering what&amp;rsquo;s up with the over the top, nearly fan-ship name, trust me, I was not on anything when I wrote this.
I simply wanted to write about a playground project I had written to get Docker working with Heroku, specifically in the context of writing a Discord bot in Kotlin.
I made a rather comprehensive guide to go with the project over on GitHub and I wish to share it here as well since it was a rather large milestone.</description></item><item><title>Applications of Kotlin's delegate properties</title><link>/post/kotlin-delegate-properties/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/kotlin-delegate-properties/</guid><description>Announcement time! After a long hiatus from kMD2PDF, I revved up my engines and began to work on my latest planned feature for the project&amp;hellip;
YAML support!
Yes, now YAML is in the works and you can now control basic attributes of your exported document using only front matter YAML.
This is an incredibly big milestone as this allows anyone to quickly customise their document without having to write a single line of Kotlin, and with another planned release to create a GUI exporter for markdown documents, this would greatly streamline users&amp;rsquo; experience.</description></item><item><title>Diving into (Java) streams</title><link>/post/diving-into-streams/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/diving-into-streams/</guid><description>What are streams? Streams was introduced in Java 1.8 and it had completely changed how we write code. The majority of what I will be discussing will be what I have learnt from watching this talk by Venkat Subramaniam. His talk was what had originally got me into using streams and the concept of lambdas.
Let&amp;rsquo;s revise How do we implement a lambda in Java? Lambdas are simple constructs with very powerful use cases in Java and many other languages.</description></item></channel></rss>
