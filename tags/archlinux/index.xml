However, as I am on Manjaro Linux - a Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, I was unable to get the native support that MacOS has.
I stumbled upon UxPlay as a potential solution for this problem.
UxPlay is an AirPlay Unix mirroring server that acts like an AppleTV for screen-mirroring on the machine that is running the server.</description></item></channel></rss>
