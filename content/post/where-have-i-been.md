I have not been posting a lot on this blog for quite a while now. This is not because I have
stopped being interested in writing. Quite the opposite actually. I have been working with other
companies like BetterStack and CodeCrafter's [OSS History](https://osshistory.org/p/elixir) to
create articles for them.

I have also been working on several big projects like my
[Technical Interview Study Guide](https://interviews.woojiahao.com) and
[Omashu](https://github.com/woojiahao/omashu).

I have several articles in mind that I would like to post on this blog so stay tuned!
