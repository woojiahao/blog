2025 marks my tenth year in tech. 15 year old me would not have imagined that 25 year old me would be having so much fun
with a random hobby he picked up but here I am, pursuing tech as a career!

To mark ten years in tech, I thought it would be fun to document my journey in tech so far. I also wanted to point out the amount of "failures" I received throughout my ten year journey, to serve as a reminder that everyone starts somewhere and getting started it always the hardest step.

## Secondary School: 2014 - 2016

Wow! That took a while to recap! It has been such a wonderful journey and I am so happy that 15 year old me decided to get into tech. I got to meet so many amazing people and work on so many interesting problems.

Although I have had many successes as well, I have faced many failures as well (10 in total!) and these failures have taught me so much. The past ten years has been so fun and I can't wait to see what the next 10 years has in store for me! ðŸŽ‰
