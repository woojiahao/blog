2025 marks my tenth year in tech. 15 year old me would not have imagined that 25 year old me would be having so much fun
with a random hobby he picked up but here I am, pursuing tech as a career!

To mark ten years in tech, I thought it would be fun to document my journey into tech.

## Secondary School: 2014 - 2016

- Got a [Samsung Galaxy Ace 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Ace_2)
- Started getting into Android ROMs, installing things like [Cyanogenmod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod) and
    [MIUI](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/18ni90y/its_the_sad_end_of_custom_roms_on_xiaomi_devices/)
- Started lurking in the [XDA forums](https://xdaforums.com/)
- Decided to start learning Android development from a YouTube series (I couldn't find the series anymore ðŸ˜”)
- Did not really understand Android development so decided to give up
- Printed out [tutorials on Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial) and trying to learn Java (but not to much
    success)
- Still felt really intrigued by programming so started visiting the
    [public library](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/visit-us/our-libraries-and-locations/libraries/yishun-public-library)
    to borrow books on programming like [C#](https://www.dummies.com/book/technology/programming-web-design/csharp/c-2010-all-in-one-for-dummies-292899/) and [web development](https://www.amazon.sg/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189)
- Tried setting up the family computer ([Toshiba Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook_Satellite)) to dual boot [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and Windows, accidentally wiped the
    Windows partition instead ðŸ¤¡
- Discovered [a video about why programming is important](https://youtu.be/Dv7gLpW91DM?si=8Vdb2-jIO8e-PuRc)

</div>

- Ignited a deeper interest in me to learn more about it and treat it as a fun hobby and community
- Dad brought me to [Bras Basah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras_Basah) to browse second-hand bookstores and I got
    books about [C++](https://www.amazon.sg/Absolute-C-Walter-Savitch/dp/0133970787) and [iOS development](https://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programmers-App-Driven-Approach-Developer/dp/0133965260)
- Installed [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) to learn C++
- Did not have an Apple machine to learn iOS development (yes, the book became useless)
- Started picking up C++ and understanding the fundamentals of programming
- But really struggled with understanding pointers (who doesn't on their first attempt)
- Took the [O-Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore-Cambridge_GCE_Ordinary_Level) and did really well (L1R4 of 4 and L1R5 of 6)
- Faced with making a tricky decision of choosing [Junior College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_college_(Singapore)) or [Polytechnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_technology)
- Unsure if I should study chemical engineering or information technology (yes, I did pick a JC as the very last choice)
